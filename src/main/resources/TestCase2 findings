Test Case 2 cannot be automated 100% due to captcha images while submitting the form.

This can be handled by either

1. Disabling the captcha in lower environment for testing purpose (or)
2. Execute the steps till captcha and add wait time to complete captcha manually (this is possible in only local machine)
